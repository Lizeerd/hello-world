# hello-world
journey to programming, and some notes of my naive ideas

Hallo Humans!

Lizy here. I love eatting and lying on my cozy bed a lot. I'm humorous, ha, only able to make me myself laugh233. The enthusiasm for mathematical models, which helps delve into some real problems(e.g.optimize the use of taxi resources with regard to time and space) ,  directs me to programming, with which those models can be implemented in a simpler and intuitionistic way.
